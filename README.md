# stm32-Synth
A powerful midi synth based on the stm32f103cb
IMPORTANT:This project uses the stm32f103cb NOT the stm32f103c8, the code requires 110k of flash.
The coocox website is down so you need to get it from somewhere else:(that "somewhere else" https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Coding-languages-Compilers/CooCox-CoIDE.shtml)
